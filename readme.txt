INTRODUCTION
============
Quick Tabs is a tab management browser action extension for the Google Chrome web browser based on the "Recent Files"
quick selector build into the excellent IntelliJ IDEA by Jetbrains.

Move quickly between recently used tabs without requiring the use of your mouse, locate and switch to tabs as you need
them with minimal keystrokes even when you have large numbers of open tabs.



FEATURES
========

* list all open tabs

* tab list maintained in order of last usage

* keyboard navigation of tab list (up and down arrow keys, enter to select)

* quick search open tabs

* shortcut key Ctrl + e to launch popup window (most windows due to limitation within Chrome)

* indicates how many tabs you currently have open



CHROME API WISH LIST
====================

* shortcut keys for browser action extensions - this would allow the extension to work with only "tab" permissions
    and not require access to the users computer simply to run its contentScript :|
