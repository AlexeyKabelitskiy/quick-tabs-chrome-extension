Quick Tabs allows you to move quickly between recently used tabs without requiring the use of your mouse, locate and switch to tabs as you need them with minimal keystrokes even when you have large numbers of open tabs.

Visit the "Quick Tabs":https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/jnjfeinjfmenlddahdjdmgpbokiacbbb google extensions page to install this and try it out ...
